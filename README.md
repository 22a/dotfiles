# Dotfiles
### aka. Spooky Wizard Incantation Configuration

My spooky configuration of zsh, tmux, and neovim.

## Prerequisites

These dotfiles have been designed solely for neovim in iTerm2 on macOS. For \*nix / regular vim support check out the [linus branch](https://github.com/22a/dotfiles/tree/linus).

## Warnings

The install script has been setup with a fresh macOS install in mind, it assumes a blank canvas. **It will forcibly symlink over your dotfiles** if you let it.

I have tested this on macOS Sierra 10.12.3, brew had a falling out with sierra at the beginning and may do the same with future versions of OSX.


## Installation

Install the xcode command line tools:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```
Click accept, accept, etc.

Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/22a/dotfiles.git
```

Run the install scripts:
```bash
cd dotfiles; make
```

### Other misc bits that haven't been automated yet:
* git config

### Things to do manually

#### Generate ssh + gpg keypairs, Configure ssh-agent + gpgtools

#### Disable spotlight keyboard shortcuts, Set alfred keyboard shortcut
`System Preferences... -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Spotlight -> Untick both`

#### Tell iTerm2 to use the config file in `iterm2/`
Open iTerm and set the iterm preferences directory:
```
General -> Preferences -> Load preferences from a custom foler or URL
```
Then close iTerm entirely: `cmd + alt + q` and open it again.

#### Change the dotfiles remote
If you decided to clone this repo over HTTPS as opposed to SSH (because setting up ssh keys in plain old terminal is no fun) you'll want to change the repo's remote.

```
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:22a/dotfiles.git
```

## More readme bits + screenshots coming at some point...
